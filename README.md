# LaundryApp
This mini project was coded during my semester 3 using JAVA programming language
The name of our project is Express Laundry. 
This program that we design is supposed to help the owner of the laundry to manage their company with ease. 
The owner does not have to use pen and papers to record their customer information but they can just key in the data into their gadgets easily with the program. 
By using our program, there won’t be any inaccurate or lost of information and data like using files and documents. 
The program also can summarize all of the information stored in it such as:-
• Total payment customer make within a day.
• The total sale of the service' detergents.
• Total accumulated price for each washer with different temperature and each dryer with different weight capacity.
