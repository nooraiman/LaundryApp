# LaundryApp
This mini project was coded during my semester 3 using JAVA programming language <br>
The name of our project is Express Laundry. <br>
This program that we design is supposed to help the owner of the laundry to manage their company with ease. <br>
The owner does not have to use pen and papers to record their customer information but they can just key in the data into their gadgets easily with the program. <br>
By using our program, there won’t be any inaccurate or lost of information and data like using files and documents. <br>
The program also can summarize all of the information stored in it such as:- <br>
• Total payment customer make within a day. <br>
• The total sale of the service' detergents. <br>
• Total accumulated price for each washer with different temperature and each dryer with different weight capacity. <br>
